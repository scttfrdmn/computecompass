## 🎯 Immediate Next Steps

### Priority 1: AI Chat Interface (Next Session Goal)
**File to Create**: `src/components/AIChat.tsx`

**Requirements:**
- Conversational interface using RAG system
- Natural language query processing
- Performance insights and recommendations
- Cost optimization suggestions
- Integration with existing RAGIntegrationService

**Technical Approach:**
```typescript
// Use existing RAG integration service
import { RAGIntegrationService } from '../services/rag-integration'

// Process user queries
const response = await RAGIntegrationService.processNaturalLanguageQuery(
  userMessage,
  { currentInstances, workloadPattern, optimizationResults }
)
```

### Priority 2: Performance Knowledge Base Enhancement
- Integrate real AWS benchmark data when available
- Expand synthetic benchmark coverage
- Add more domain-specific optimization patterns

### Priority 3: Enterprise Features
- Advanced discount support (EDP, PPA, credits)
- Multi-project portfolio optimization
- Predictive cost modeling
